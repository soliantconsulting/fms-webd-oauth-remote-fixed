This sample website shows how you can start the OAuth login flow into a WebDirect file, right from your own web site.
Without taking the user to the WebDirect launch center or the WebDirect file's login screen.

This version is for use on web site that does not run on FileMaker Server.
It does require some HTML and JS to be on your FileMaker Server.
See the companion repo: https://github.com/wimdecorte/fms-webd-oauth-remote-companion

See this blog post for how it works:
https://www.soliantconsulting.com/blog/filemaker-custom-oauth-login-webdirect/

This functionality to fully customize the login experience already exists for logging in with regular FileMaker accounts, see this resource:
https://github.com/bharlow/fm-webdirect-custom

Enjoy!

A simple (gradient-heavy) single pager that revisits a style I messed with on two
previous designs (Tessellate and Telephasic). Fully responsive, built on Sass,
and, as usual, loaded with an assortment of pre-styled elements. Have fun! :)
